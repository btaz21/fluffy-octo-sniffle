## Approach:
Day 1 -
Brainstormed on idea and agreed upon concepts. Used paired-programming to help divvy up our work flow. Jessica initialized and handled back-end while front-end was mastered and crafted by Bobby.

Bobby took day 2 by the reigns and polished the app through CSS. We both worked to reach any additional functionality we could create and structure during this time!
