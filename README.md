## Approach:
Day 1 -
Brainstormed on idea and agreed upon concepts. Used paired-programming to do all the initial setup, including setting up the server.js file and all the routes.

Day 2 -
Bobby took day 2 by the reigns and polished the app through CSS. We both worked to reach any additional functionality we could create and structure during this time!
